QUESTION: (page 8)  
    When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. 
    For example, in the Media class, you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes as the above requirements 
    (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

ANSWER:
    If the passing object is not an instance of Media, an exception likes ClassCastException will occur during runtime.
